# React JS NavBar Sample Project

This is a simple sample project showcasing a responsive navigation bar built using React JS, styled with Tailwind CSS, and utilizing React Router DOM for page routing. The project was scaffolded using Vite.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on various devices.

- **Page Routing**: We have implemented page routing using React Router DOM, allowing you to simulate page changes when clicking on links. This makes it easy to navigate between different sections of your website without requiring a full page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **React JS**: The core library for building user interfaces in JavaScript.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling and makes it easy to create responsive designs.

- **React Router DOM**: A popular library for handling routing in React applications, enabling smooth and efficient navigation.

- **Vite**: A fast development build tool that helps you get started quickly with modern web development, including React.
